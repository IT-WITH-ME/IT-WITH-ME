**Thursday 1st December**

Hi guys, today I managed to add a container to my blog which makes it look so much better so that's good also the same problem happened with the late update on my blog but it's working now. So that's all good also I changed the background and avatar to christmas images because  CHRISTMAS!!! Also I will try to post personal posts every day till christmas because if there are any people watching other then my teachers you now have entertainment for the holiday. Also sir if you're reading this I will add school in brackets on school day. Next week I will create a code that will make a conversation out of yes and no questions.

Nick signing off, bye.
