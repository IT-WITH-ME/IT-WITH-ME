    <td>I just really concentrated really hard and managed to make it to 14% by the end of the lesson. I also did all the quizzes along the way so I can recall a lot more about what I have learnt I also found that really reading every bit of the text helped a lot.

    <td>I need to sort out my account so I can start where I left off. There were also some moments in which I lost concentration which cost me time I didn't have.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Make sure my account works and I can login to it and also I need to constantly have full concentration all times. This will allow me to learn faster and take in more information.
