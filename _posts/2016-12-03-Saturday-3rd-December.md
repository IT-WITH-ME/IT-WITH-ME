**Saturday 3rd December**

Today I had to wake up at 6 am to get everything ready to go and play a game of rugby for my school it was really annoying because that's earlier than I wake up on a weekday but we won 35-30 so I guess all's well that ends well it was a really tense  finally play at 30-30 but thanks to an amazing last minute try (not by me) we won and we got free after match food. Now I am back at home just relaxing tomorrow I another rugby match with my club side so i have to get to sleep early again.

Nick signing off, Bye.
