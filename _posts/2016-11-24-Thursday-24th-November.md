**Thursday 24th November**

Hi guys, today everyone was allowed a whole lesson to improve their blogs. And it went well because I now have a image background which looks good. It was funny though because I thought nothing had changed and my blog wasn't updating. But when I got home about an hour ago I found out that it just took ages to update, so it worked and better late than never.

Nick signing off, bye.
