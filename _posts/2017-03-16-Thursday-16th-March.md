    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I aim to reach 57% on the course by the end of the lesson which is double the amount I normally do.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I reached 57% just before the end of the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I didn't talk to anyone and just focused on my work and this proved to help me a lot with maintaining my concentration and flow of my work so I proceeded very quickly. I also spent the first 5 minutes of the lesson revising what I had done before which really helped me remember how some older things we learnt work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I spent a while thinking about whether a certain thing would work when i could have just tested it instead. I also could have revised at home instead so I didn’t use up time in lesson to code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will test everything over and over rather than just think about whether it will work, I will also revise at home before next week’s lesson.</td>
  </tr>
