Monday 27th November

Today we switched topic and have begun to learn python on [www.repl.it](www.repl.it) and so far it isn't too difficult. However I cannot seem to get one if statement in my code to run as it keeps saying there is a syntax error although when I compared it to the code on the board the colon that repl was calling incorrect was also on the board so it may just be repl being a bit broken. For homework we had to add 3 new questions to our artificial intelligence systems which I have done but I still can’t get my first if statement to run so next week I will work to try and fix that issue and I will probably be taught something else to put into the program but that won’t work until I fix the syntax error so I might put the new code in a separate program until the current program begins to work again.
