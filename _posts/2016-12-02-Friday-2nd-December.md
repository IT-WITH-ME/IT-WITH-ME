**Friday 2nd December**

Hi guys, today not much happened just normal lessons, not much happened at break or lunch either obviously it's still good to see my friends. English was fun our teacher makes the lessons as fun as possible and yet somehow we still learn a lot. I also had geography which we got nothing done in. I feel sorry for our teacher because our class gave him a bit of a hard time, so sir I know you probably wonâ€™t read this but on behalf of my class sorry. Sincerely. 

Nick signing off, bye.
