  <tr>
    <td>I communicated with the other students around me in order to work out what I had done wrong in my code so that I could work out how to fix the errors. And we also worked together think up more possible questions for our programs. I found that when we worked in a group we could come up with lots of ideas for questions as it is hard to stick to 1 category of questions so we occasionally came up with ideas that would work for the people around us.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sadly the issue with giving each other ideas is that you do end up slipping into other conversation which is unrelated to the task at hand but generally throughout the lesson we managed to keep this under control and only occasionally went off task.</td>

    <td>I will make sure that I don't talk to the students around me about things unrelated to the work that I am doing.</td>
