**Friday 9th September**

Hi guys today at school we were told to reflect on last year on our blogs so guess what that's what I'm doing, enjoy!

Last year I didn't listen well enough in class so on occasions I had to ask my friends for help with homework as I didnâ€™t really know how to operate things. This showed when I spent an hour and a half trying to make the blog I had last year when other people only took about 30 minutes to create it. I also occasionally forgot to add a blog post so at the end of the year I had to fill in five blogs that i had missed only to delete it over the summer holidays. Though when I knew what i was doing it was easy to complete the work.

That's all for this week bye!
