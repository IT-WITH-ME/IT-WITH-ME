**Thursday 3rd November**

Hi guys, today Seb and I joined up with Scott and Podge to work on one big code but it resulted in disaster. The plan was for us all to do some of the code and then put it all together sadly it didn't work as we didn’t put it together correctly :( well we tried I guess. Next week I’ll  just work with Seb again sorry Scott and Podge.

Nick signing off, bye
