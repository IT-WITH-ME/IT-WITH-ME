**Thursday 10th November**

Hi guys, today we did even more Fuze Box work which is getting a bit boring but it's on the syllabus so we kind of have to do it still it could be worse. But we make it fun with jokes though we need to juggle that with actually doing work which was not really that hard because you choose if things are too hard to do something easier but obviously itâ€™s pointless to do something too easy.

Nick signing off, bye
