**Thursday 6th October**

Once again we were coding on The Fuze Box and I finally have a memory stick I'm sure you’re all happy for me. We completed a code that was based off something from the book we called it "what's your nam?" we meant to call it “what’s your name?” but turns out we can’t spell who’d a thunk it. Btw that a joke I am not illiterate. But really the lesson today was so fun and we also got a lot of work done which is new for us. Btw that's another joke don’t take it the wrong way. :)

Nick signing off, bye
