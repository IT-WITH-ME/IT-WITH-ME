    <td>I learnt how to change binary to hexadecimal. I found listening then trying it out on notes is the best way of learning it understanding it and remembering it. You can change binary to hexadecimal by splitting the number into groups of 4 digits and and changing those groups as if they are the only numbers then you put the groups back together.</td>
