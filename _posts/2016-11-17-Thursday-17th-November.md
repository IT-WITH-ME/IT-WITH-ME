**Thursday 17th November**

Hi guys, today we finally did something different yay. It wasn't too great but it turned out that it was a lesson in which the teachers told us what marks are blogs would get which was helpful. Turns out I really need to work on my blog. Sorry for that guys I’ll work to improve it hopefully you will see the difference very soon. I will need to add a image background and a container so I’ll see if I can do that for next week. So expect change.

Nick signing off, bye
