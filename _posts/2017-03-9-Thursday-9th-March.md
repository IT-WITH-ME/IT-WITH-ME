    <td>Looking back at some of the old code to remind myself and also reading the information at least twice really helped me absorb new information as well as remembering some of the older information this helped me know almost immediately what to code.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the beginning I was struggling to remember what to code when needed to complete simple tasks which I had learnt a while ago. I think this was because I wasn't revising what I had done previously.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will look back at the previous pieces of code to refamiliarize myself with the old code this will allow me to progress faster.</td>
