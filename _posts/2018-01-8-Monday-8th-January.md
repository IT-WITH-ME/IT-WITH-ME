    <td>Listen to the explanations at the beginning of the lesson and use that information to create something a program on repl.it</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I listened to the demonstration at the beginning of the lesson and then as soon as I got back to my computer I replicated what we had just been shown before adapting the code to serve more purposes. In today's lesson for example we were looking at functions so we created a program for a basic calculator and on top of the original functions I added a squaring function.</td>

    <td>Sometimes I need to slow down a bit because I am making a few errors in syntax and end up with a lot of error messages which I have to go back and fix.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will slow down when typing in my code to avoid unnecessary errors which should actually make my work faster as i won’t have to keep going back and fixing errors.</td>
