    <td>Starting point:</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Learn how to improve my blog and make it easier to read and generally  make it look then it does now.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I listened to what was being said and remembered the tips given so later I can add it to my blog and thus improve it. I took some notes in my planner to help me remember it later in the day this allowed me to change my blog without having to rake my brain trying to remember what to do</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My notes were brief so some minor details had to be worked out when I was adapting my blog so if of I take notes then I need to make them more detailed so that I know exactly what to do after the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will take more detailed notes so that I remember what was said in the lesson. This will allow me to redo things i have already done to my blog.</td>
