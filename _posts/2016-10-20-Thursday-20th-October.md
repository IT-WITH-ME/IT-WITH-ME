**Thursday 20th October**

Hello, me again nice to see you, I mean you talk to you, I meanâ€¦. never mind. Anyway today we did more Fuze Box work surprising I know but today we did more stop animation but failed miserably as our Spongebob looked more like a yellow square with completely white eyes. Seb worked really hard to fix it but nothing could be done :( R.I.P Spongebob died of ugliness  2016. Anyway that's pretty much all we did. Next week we are going to try to complete Spongebob.

Nick signing off, bye
