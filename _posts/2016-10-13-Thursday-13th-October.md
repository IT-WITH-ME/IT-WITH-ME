**Thursday 13th October**

Today Seb and I worked more on The Fuze Boxes it was so fun we took everything we knew and put it together to get one ultimate code. Which was filled with jokes turns out we don't have a sense of humour who knew? Anyway today was very fun and we got loads done hopefully this productivity will continue.

Nick signing off, bye.
