Monday 9th October 2017

Hello, welcome to a new year of blogs as we are already four weeks into the new year of lessons I am going to put all four blogs into this one blog. We have begun to use google sheets @[sheets.google.com](http://sheets.google.com) to code and decode sentences. The coding wasn't that challenging the only issues I had were caused by me challenging myself to try and make the system work without the lines of extra text. I have managed to get the code for decoding messages down to only taking up 3 of the original 4 lines of code needed to make it run. We have learned a lot of new commands such as =vlookup, =lookup, =right, =left and =concatenate. So far most of the work has been copying down code from the board onto our computer but I think that in the future we will begin having to work out what to code to fix a given problem.
