**15th September**

Hi, today we learnt how to use a 'Fuse Box' but not an electrical one but a Computer one instead. My partner and I werenâ€™t very successful and failed to complete the exercises. Though we kept trying and got some stuff done but sadly we didn't have a memory stick so we have lost all our code. :(

Nick signing off, bye
