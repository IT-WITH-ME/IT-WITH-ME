    <td>The quizzes were very useful in remembering what I had just learnt and Codecademy is also really simple and easy to use so I didn't even need to remember how to use it because I could have easily used it anyway</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>

  <tr>
    <td>I skipped some of the quizzes which made it harder for me to remember what I had learnt so I didn’t remember exactly what I didn’t</td>

    <td>If I do codecademy again I need to do all the quizzes so that I can remember what I learnt. </td>
