**Thursday 29 September**

Hi guys today me and my Friend Seb managed to make a Pac-man move like he would in a game which was really cool but sadly we still don't have a memory stick and I have been tasked with getting it for next lesson hopefully I wonâ€™t forget or I will have to deal with losing all my code again.

Bye
